# Development Log 

## Week 1 (Date: 10/30/2022 -- 11/05/2022)
#### Weekly Goals
Our goal this week is to set up the regulations in our group, decide the topic of our final project, and create our GitHub repo. We have successfully finished all of our goals, though in a hurry.

#### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
We all participated in selecting dataset and algorithms.
Sihan Cheng (sihanc6): Completed Team Contract and Development Log 1.
Mingqi Wang (mingqiw2): Finished and modified Project Proposal, especially the Algorithm part, and built the GitHub Repo
Kelly Dai (jingyud2): Modified Project Proposal(Data correction and Data storage) and Team Contract.
Teresa Zhang (lingyiz4): Finished Project Proposal Leading Question, Data Format and Timeline part.

#### Problems Encountered 
We overall worked well but we did not plan on the workflow as our first step, so things went a bit messy. Besides, all of us are way too busy, so sometimes it is hard to have everyone work on their part on time.

#### Plans for next week
We plan to start off by making a weekly plan, then splitting the work among each group member. We will do some further research regarding the project topic.

#### Optional: Questions for mentor


## Week 2 (Date: 11/13/2022 -- 11/19/2022)

## Weekly Goals
Our goal this week is to discuss and review the project proposal with the mentor's feedback and then assign tasks (such as cleaning data and building algorithms) to each group member for next week.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Sihan Cheng (sihanc6): Reviewed the Project Proposal and completed Development Log 2.
Mingqi Wang (mingqiw2): Reviewed and modified the Project Proposal.
